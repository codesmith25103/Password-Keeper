# Password-Keeper
<p>A CLI-based application written in JavaScript using Node.js and MongoDB. It utilizes libraries such as Chalk, Inquirer, and Bcrypt. The purpose of this interactive application is to securely store passwords. Nowadays, we have numerous services that require sign-in credentials, and it's common to forget some passwords, leading to potential future troubles. To address this problem, we have developed a CLI-based secure app.</p>

<h3>To run the app: </h3>
<p>npm install</p>
<p>node app.js</p>
